# Dumpy Chatbot

This is a project for CS2103T NUS School of Computing.

I chose to name it _Dumpy_ as it is rather dumb compared to LLM Chatbots
that are widely available today. However, through this project I would
like to demonstrate how a simple chatbot could potentially be more fun
compared to LLM Chatbots.

If allowed, I am aiming to integrate LLM into this Chatbot too

## Development environment
